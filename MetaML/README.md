# MetaML
MetaML is a Machine Learning Library that includes some of the significant ML algorithmic models created from scratch supported with Visualizations and Utility Functions.


## Library consists of:
1. Models related to shallow Learning (Compliment of Deep Learning)
2. Data Preprocessing and utility Functions
3. Data Visualization functions

## 1. Models in ML and Deep Learning:

a. Supervised Learning:

    - Regression:
